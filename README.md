# Digital Twine

In order to train new employees in a virtual world using the metaverse, we created an industry digital twin for the car manufacturing sector.

- A digital twin is a digital representation of an intended or actual real-world physical product, system, or process
- serves as the effectively indistinguishable digital counterpart of it for practical purposes, such as simulation, integration, testing, monitoring, and maintenance.
- A digital twin can be used in the Automotive industry, Manufacturing operations, Healthcare services, etc.

# METAVERS

- A hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal, and immersive virtual world facilitated by virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets.
- Mixed reality (MR) is a technology that allows not only the superposition of digital elements into the real-world environment but also their interaction
- Various other industries appear in the metaverse to access the opportunities it will bring for professionals and businesses.
